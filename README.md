# Simple Configs & Scripts

Just some configs and scrpts to make things a bit easier


## Tiny Overview

These configs setup the visual part of Alacritty, preparing window start mode,
font, cursor and colors. As well as demonstrate some of the shortcuts and
scripts that I use to make my life easier.

I prefer a keyboard orinted experience on terminal, and don't quite enjoy
the clutter of a multiplexer. So 100% of the behaviour of the Alacritty 
terminal is instance based and helped by scripts.

Together with Alacritty, I use NeoVim. My NeoVim configs here:

## Pathing

### Linux

Uses:

`~/.config/alacritty/` as the $BASE folder.

`$BASE/alacritty.toml`

`$BASE/bash_scripts/` for scripts.

`$BASE/extra_configs/linux_keybindings.toml` for keybinds.


### Windows

==UNDONE==
The Windows part of these configs were lost on my recent win pc crash-and-burn.
Some of the scripts and files are still here, but not correct on many cases.
I'll get it back up when I can.
==UNDUNE==


## Scripts & Locations

Please make sure to read all the scripts in the `extra_configs/` path.
All of the scripts are set up to work for my needs and for my way of 
*feeling* the terminal and tools.
